# Bendystraw data policy

Every indexed read follows one production pattern:

1. Execute a committed, static GraphQL document through
   `requestBendystraw`.
2. Resolve mainnet or testnet with the SDK from every `chainId` and
   `chainId_in` in the request. Unknown, contradictory, or mixed networks fail
   closed.
3. Validate bounded variables before sending and recursively validate the
   selected response shape before returning data to product code.
4. Scope project data with the SDK's exact versioned project-reference filters
   and verify returned identities at the response boundary.
5. Use only the SDK cache policies: `live` (15 seconds) for balances, activity,
   permissions, and mutable state; `standard` (30 seconds) for lists, search,
   and aggregates; `stable` (60 seconds) for metadata and historical records.

The Bendystraw transport does not cache. Writes invalidate or bypass affected
reads. An indexed read may fall back to an authoritative RPC read only when the
fallback preserves the same chain/project/account identity and the result is
marked degraded where relevant. A timeout, schema error, or malformed response
must never be converted into zero, an empty list, or a different project's
data.

CI validates every committed document against both live Bendystraw schemas.
Runtime tests must cover invalid variables, malformed nested responses, mixed
networks, unsupported chains, and any identity-scoped fallback.
